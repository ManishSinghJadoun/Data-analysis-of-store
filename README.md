data analysis and giving insights
We analyzed the dataset across 50 stores and 20 SKUs per store (1,000 records) and calculated:

Conversion Rate (CR) = Transactions Ã· Total Visits

Aggregations were done SKU-wise and Store-wise

ðŸ”¹ Top Performers
Top SKU by Conversion Rate:
SKU ID: SKU_11   Conversion Rate: 58.60%  Revenue: â‚¹1,665,863.73

Top Store by Conversion Rate:
Store ID: Store_39  Conversion Rate: 66.47%  Revenue: â‚¹667,804.09

ðŸ”¹ Underperformers
Bottom SKU by Conversion Rate:
e.g., SKU_9 â€“ Conversion Rate ~29%

Bottom Store by Conversion Rate:
e.g., Store_7 â€“ Conversion Rate ~33%

Key Trends Identified

1. High-Converting SKUs Do Not Always Have Highest Revenue
2. SKU_11 has the best conversion rate, but SKU_7 had higher revenue despite lower CR, suggesting higher-value or higher-priced products.
3. Conversion Rate Correlates with Traffic Quality
4. Stores with moderate traffic but high CR (like Store_39) outperform stores with more visits but poorer engagement.
5. Wide SKU Performance Gap Within Stores
6. Some stores show strong performance for a few SKUs but fail on othersâ€”highlighting SKU targeting or shelf placement as potential factors.

âœ… Recommendations

1. Optimize Inventory Around High-Performing SKUs
2. Prioritize stocking and promotion for SKUs like SKU_11 across more stores.
3. Phase out or investigate underperforming SKUs.
4. Replicate Best Practices from High-CR Stores
5. Audit Store_39 operations (e.g., pricing, layout, staff behavior) and apply insights to low-converting stores.
6. Customer Journey Analysis for Low-CR SKUs
7. Look into drop-off reasons using session data, price sensitivity, or product placement issues.
